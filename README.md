# cow-calc

Cow Calc is a companion tool for the game Call of War. (hence the name)

If you don't know, Call of War is a realtime strategy game in which you try to conquer the world.

It is a cool and unique game, but one thing that trips people up are battles.

In order to win one you have to keep track of lots of variables like:
- How much damage does this stack do?
- What is the composition of the stack? (ie: 50% unarmored, 30% light armor, 20% heavy armor)
- Are there hidden multipliers and terrain bonuses affecting the outcome?

And then, after crunching the numbers, this might happen:
- Wait why am I losing?? Oh, it's because the enemy stack is in its **core territory**, so every calculation I did was off ðŸ˜­
or
- Wait artillery gets a **50% bonus** in hills and mountains?? So that's why my army got shredded ðŸ˜­

This is why I made Cow Calc, a website that does all of the math for you so that you can focus on the game rather than your calculator!
