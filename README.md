# cow-calc

If you don't know, Call of War is a game in which you try to conquer the world using the best possible strategy.

There has been one thing about it that has annoyed me though, which are battles. It seems like you have to keep track of lots of variables like:
- How much damage does this stack do?
- What is the composition of the stack?
- etc

And then, after keeping track of all of this and doing all the math, this happens:
- Oh no, that stack is in its core territory, so every calculation I did is wrong now...

This is why I made Cow Calc, an app that does all of the math for you and displays it in a nice UI!
